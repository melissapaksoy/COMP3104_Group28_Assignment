--History of George Brown College--

George Brown College opened its doors in 1968, welcoming just over 2,000 students. 
In addition to programs in construction, early childhood education, dental services and the culinary arts,
the instituiton once offered programs that might not be quite as relevant today, like signwriting and watchmaking.

Since 2004, George Brown has more than doubled in size, 
broadened its international partnerships 
and increased their commitment to strengthening the cultural, economic and social fabric of Toronto.
