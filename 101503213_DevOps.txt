COMP 3104 is a DevOps course I'm taking in my 5th semester of T177 
Computer Programming and Technology program at George Brown College.

COMP 3104 is one of the most practical courses this semester! 
It teaches us how developers and IT operations work together to make 
software updates faster and smoother — basically, DevOps is teamwork 
+ automation. 

We’re learning to use GitHub, branches, and CI/CD tools like 
GitHub Actions to keep our code organized and always tested. 
It’s cool because it feels like we’re working the same way real 
software teams do in tech companies.

I'm really enjoying this course and looking forward to completing it 
with an A+!! <3
