George Brown College is one of Torontoâ€™s top colleges offering hands-on programs.
It provides strong industry connections and real-world experience for students.
I study Computer Programming and Analysis and enjoy the supportive environment here.
The college has multiple downtown Toronto campuses and strong student services like advising, tutoring, and career events.
Co-op and placement options help students gain practical experience while studying.
