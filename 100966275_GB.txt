The George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology is a public, 
fully accredited college of applied arts and technology with three 
campuses in downtown Toronto (Ontario, Canada). Like many other colleges 
in Ontario, George Brown College was chartered in 1966 by the government of 
Ontario and opened the next year.

- Fun fact about me that I actually graduated from George Brown College 
10 years ago studying Fashion Techniques and Design and I am back 10 years
later, studying Computer Programming Analysis. Double degree for the win!
