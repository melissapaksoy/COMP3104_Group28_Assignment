Comp3104 Devops is being conducted by Professor Pritesh Patel.
By far, this is one of the courses that I'm genuinely enjoying. 

Let's take a brief look at why Devops is an integral part 
of an aspiring Software Developer such as myself.

DevOps, combining development and operations, is crucial for modern software development. 
It enables faster delivery through Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, 
allowing developers to iterate quickly and respond to feedback. 
DevOps fosters collaboration between development, testing, and operations teams, 
helping developers understand how applications behave in production. 
Familiarity with automation tools, monitoring, and deployment pipelines enhances problem-solving 
and ensures software reliability. 
Additionally, knowledge of DevOps makes developers more versatile and competitive in the job market. 
For aspiring software developers, mastering DevOps is key to building efficient, high-quality, and production-ready applications.
