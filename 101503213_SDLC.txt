DevOps plays a huge role in modern software development. 
Instead of waiting weeks to release updates, teams using DevOps can 
push new features out almost instantly. 
It connects every stage of the SDLC — from coding and testing to 
deployment and monitoring — so nothing gets stuck along the way. 
In short, DevOps helps everyone work smarter, not harder, and keeps 
customers happy with faster, more reliable updates.

I'm grateful to be a part of this DevOps course, as it prepares me for 
real-world software development jobs. The SDLC is the core of 
successful projects
