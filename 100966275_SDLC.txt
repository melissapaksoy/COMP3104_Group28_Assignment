Learning DevOps is important because it bridges development and operations, 
improving collaboration, automation, and efficiency. It helps teams deliver 
software faster, detect issues early, and maintain reliable, high-quality 
systems throughout the development cycle.

-For me, understanding DevOps is especially valuable because it connects 
both the creative and technical sides of software development and allowing 
me to build projects that are not only functional but also efficiently 
managed and scalable in real-world environments.
