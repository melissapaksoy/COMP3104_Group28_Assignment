DevOps improves the SDLC by connecting all stages from coding to deployment.
It makes feedback faster, reduces bugs, and increases release frequency.
This helps teams deliver better software with less manual effort.
Continuous integration helps teams detect issues early in development.
A simple CI/CD pipeline (build → test → deploy) keeps releases frequent and reliable.
Overall, DevOps shortens feedback loops, reduces defects, and helps teams ship faster with confidence.
