George Brown College was founded in 1967 and has become one of Toronto’s 
most well-known colleges for hands-on education. 
It started with just a few programs but now offers hundreds across 
business, tech, health, and design. 

I'm currently pursuing an advance diploma of Computer Programming and 
Analysis program at the Casa Loma campus, which is surrounded by 
beautiful old architecture and lots of energy from other students. 
Even though my classes are there, I love studying at the Waterfront 
campus library — it’s got an amazing lake view and it’s only about 
five minutes from my place by bike. 
The calm vibe there makes it a perfect spot to focus and get work done 
after a busy week of classes.

I'm so excited to become a software developer after graduating next 
semester!
